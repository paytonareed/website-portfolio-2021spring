                          <h3>The Solutions</h3>
                          <p>The US government has several important policies to enforce sustainable practices and to advocate for the planet.The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to work with the states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Several energy policy laws ensure that the Department of Energy partners with the private sector to improve clean energy technologies and set efficiency standards. The Department of Transportation has laws to ensure improved fuel economy of vehicles, and the Department of Defense is bound by law to plan for the consequenses of global climate change. But government regulation still has a long ways to go. One exciting new proposal is the Green New Deal by Representative AOC. It calls for a plan to decrease the US's use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions while stimulating new jobs in clean energy sectors. </p>
                          <p>There are also several new promising emerging technologies that are aimed towards clean energy and climate protection. HERMES is a cold fusion concept to capture excess hear during heavy water electrolysis as a form of clean energy. MetaVEH is a innovation to harvest electrochemical energy and have the potential to replace harmful batteries. TPX-Power is a project that aims to recover thermo energy from waste heat during photon transport. And LICROX is another project focused on solar fuel production from the chemical energy storage in photosynthesis. </p>
